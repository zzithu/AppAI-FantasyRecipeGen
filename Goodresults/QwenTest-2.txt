### INSTRUCTIONS

In the heart of a bustling village nestled among rolling hills where tales intertwine with reality, gather all necessary components under moonlight; these will transform ordinary elements into something extraordinary through alchemical magic! Begin at dusk when shadows dance upon cobblestones beneath starlit skies...

Firstly, prepare the waterskin filled with purest mountain spring water—this shall symbolize purity before any dish begins its journey towards perfection. Place one half cup of fresh, briny sea fish known only to fishermen who dare venture beyond familiar shores onto clean plates. Let them soak together until dawn
